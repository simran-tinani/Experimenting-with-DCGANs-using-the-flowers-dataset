# Experimenting-with-DCGANs-using-the-flowers-dataset


The DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) developed by Alec Radford, Luke Metz and Soumith Chintala (2016) has been used extensively for the generation of images. In this model, each of the generator and the discriminator is a deep convolution neural network (CNN). Several architectures, additional features, and modifications have been incorporated into the DCGAN, and it has been found to perform well on most popular image data sets.

In this project, we will experiment with two versions of the DCGAN architecture, and two different versions of a data set comprising of images of different species of flowers. The first data set (flowers-17) comprises of only 1360 images of 17 varieties of flowers, while the second data set (flowers-102) comprises of 8189 images of 102 varieties of flowers. Thus, apart from empirically studying the effects of tuning hyper-parameters and modifying the architecture, we will also witness the level of difference brought about in performance by expanding the training data set.
